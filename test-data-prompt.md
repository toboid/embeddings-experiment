Create 50 unique reviews for a fictional luxury hotel, The Rainforest Hotel, located in Brighton. These reviews should reflect a mix of experiences, capturing the essence of staying at the hotel. Please ensure the output is formatted as a JavaScript array of objects, where each object represents a review with two properties: review (a string containing the text of the review) and rating (a numerical value indicating the review's rating on a scale from 1 to 5). The reviews should be divided into three categories:

- **Positive Reviews (8 reviews):** Emphasize the hotel's strengths, such as exceptional customer service, stunning views, luxurious amenities (spa, dining, etc.), and the overall atmosphere of elegance and comfort. Ratings for these reviews should range between 4 and 5.
- **Negative Reviews (8 reviews):** Highlight areas where the hotel falls short, including but not limited to, outdated rooms, lackluster service, issues with cleanliness or noise, and any other aspects that detracted from the guest experience. Ratings for these reviews should fall between 1 and 2.
- **Balanced Reviews (9 reviews):** Offer a nuanced view that acknowledges both what the hotel does well and areas for improvement. These reviews should mention specific positives (e.g., location, certain amenities) alongside criticisms, aiming for a fair assessment. Ratings should be between 3 and 4.

Example of Desired Output Format:
```js
[
  {"review": "Absolutely loved our stay at The Rainforest Hotel in Brighton! The sea view was breathtaking, and the staff went above and beyond. Can't wait to return!", "rating": 5},
  {"review": "While this hotel boasts impressive amenities, our room felt a bit outdated. Enjoyed the spa, but room for improvement in room decor.", "rating": 3},
  // Continue with additional 23 reviews following the specified guidelines
]
```

The goal is to craft a diverse and realistic set of guest feedback for The Grand, providing future guests with insights into what they might expect from their stay. Each review should be distinct and provide a unique perspective on the hotel experience.
